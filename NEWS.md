## Breaking changes

* Most colours used within `ghibli` palettes have seen hex values updates. In most cases, these are extremely small hex value tweaks. Several colours within the `MarnieLight1` and `MarnieMedium1` palettes have changed noticeably, where these were inconsistent with source material.

# Version 0.2.0

* Added support for relevant ggplot2 scales (continuous/discrete).

# Version 0.1.2

* Fixed malformed documentation in `ghibli_palette`.
* Removed a bad example plot from package vignette `ghibli-guide`.

# Version 0.1.1

* New palettes (Kiki and Totoro).

# Version 0.1.0

* First palettes and first CRAN release.
